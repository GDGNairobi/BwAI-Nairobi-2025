# Session 0 - Flutter for the Creative: Image to Story Generator with Gemini


- **Speakers**: @iamEtornam

## About the session
Building a Flutter app where users select about 5 images, and Gemini creates a story from them. This workshop focuses on using the Gemini multi-modal capabilities to analyze multiple images and then using its text generation capabilities to weave a narrative connecting the visual elements. The final result would be an engaging story produced entirely by AI based on the user's image selections.
